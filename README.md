## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run and experiment with this project, you'll need the following:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd your-repo
```

## Usage

### Dockerizing a Node.js App

Follow these steps to Dockerize a basic Node.js application:

1. **Setting Up the Basics:**
   - Initialize Node:
     ```bash
     npm init
     ```
   - Initialize Express:
     ```bash
     npm install express
     ```
   - Create the primary file "index.js" with your Express application code.

2. **Dockerizing the App:**
   - Create a Dockerfile in the same directory as "index.js" without any file extension.
   - Define the Node.js base image, copy files, install dependencies, expose ports, and set commands. Refer to the Dockerfile example in the project.

3. **Build the Docker Image:**
   - Open your terminal and run the following command:
     ```bash
     docker build -t basic_app .
     ```

4. **Run the Docker Container:**
   - Execute the following command to launch the Dockerized Express app:
     ```bash
     docker run -p 5000:5000 basic_app
     ```

### Accessing the Dockerized App

Visit "http://localhost:5000" to access the Dockerized Express app.
